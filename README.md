# dijkstra-algorithm
it's a simple implementation for dijkstra's alogrithm in PHP
# explaination 
in this example i assumed that we have graph like this :

![alt text](https://github.com/islamsamy214/dijkstra-algorithm/blob/master/dijksrta's%20graph.png?raw=true)

and i want to move from the start to the end in the shortest time,
so i have the time i will consume to move from the start to b node will be 2sec, from the start to the a is 6sec and so on like in the graph
so i used dijkstra's algorithm to solve it
